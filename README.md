# Retweet Equitizer
A simple web application that pulls from the Twitter API a specified user's timeline and subsequent original tweets. A dollar value is then assigned based on the amount of favorites and retweets -- as well as the amount of a user's followers.

To illustrate the data, chart.js has been integrated showing two line datasets. The first is the daily value, the second is the cumulative value over time.
